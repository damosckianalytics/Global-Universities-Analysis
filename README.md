# Global-Universities-Analysis

# Overview

This project analyses global university rankings from 2005 to 2016, focusing on top-performing institutions, ranking criteria, and international student distribution. The data is visualised in Power BI to provide insights into higher education trends worldwide.

# Objectives

- Identify the top-ranked universities globally from 2005 to 2016.
- Analyse key ranking criteria that influence university scores.
- Examine trends in international student enrolment by country.
- Provide data-driven insights to support decision-making in higher education.

# Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from GitHub and includes information on university rankings, ranking criteria, country and student demographics over time.

# Tools Used

- Power BI â€“ For data cleaning & preparation, data visualisation.

# Insights

- Harvard University consistently ranks among the top universities.
- Ranking factors such as publications, influence, patents, and citations play a major role in determining scores.
- The United States and the United Kingdom dominate global university rankings.
- Countries such as Switzerland, Australia, and Canada attract a significant number of international students.

# Key Findings

- Strong correlation between publications and rankings: Universities with a higher number of publications tend to score better.
- Influence and citation metrics matter: Universities with high citation and influence scores rank higher.
- International student distribution is uneven: Certain countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, attract a disproportionately large number of international students.
- Alumni employment and quality of education impact rankings: These factors, though less influential than research output, still contribute to university performance.
